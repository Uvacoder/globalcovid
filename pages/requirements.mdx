### What Success Looks Like

1. **Option 1: Build a production-ready solution for immediate impact**

- These will be projects that are ready to hit the ground running in communities around the world.
- Examples include:
  - [Neighborexpress.org](http://www.neighborexpress.org/)
  - [Projectn95.com](https://www.projectn95.com/)
  - [Bailout.nyc](https://bailout.nyc/)
  - [Covidactnow.org](https://covidactnow.org/)
  - [Saveourfaves.org](https://saveourfaves.org/)

2. **Option 2: Ship an awesome proof-of-concept with lots of potential**

- These will be conceptual projects with bucket-loads of promise.
- Examples include tools for:
  - Helping people with supplies or resources locally
  - Combating loneliness
  - Replacing income with work-from-home options

Production-ready projects will not be favored over proof-of-concepts. The judges’ north star will be submissions that have the strongest potential impact on the challenges caused by COVID-19.

### Requirements

- **Submission form**
  - Submit your project on Devpost before the deadline and be sure to answer all of the questions on the submission form. This and other information related to your submission will be treated consistent with the Devpost [privacy policy](https://info.devpost.com/privacy).
- **Video**
  - Upload a video walk-through your solution via YouTube or Vimeo, and include the link on your Devpost page for your project.
  - By submitting a video, you are acknowledging that these materials may be used to promote the hackathon anywhere in the world, without extra obligation to you.
  - Videos should be a maximum of 2 minutes long.
    - Only the first two minutes of each video will be evaluated.
- **GitHub or other code repo link (optional)**
  - Please ensure that this link is publicly shareable so judges can access your project
