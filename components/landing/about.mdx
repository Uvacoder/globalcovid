We’ve connected with a range of partners including the World Health Organization (WHO) to understand some of the key challenge areas that technological innovation could help solve.

Some examples from the WHO here include the need for accurate disease prevention information around the world in languages/formats that resonate locally, as well as regional needs for expertise, resources/supplies and financial support from donors.

Additionally, we’re suggesting the below seven themes to help spark your ideas. Remember that you’re welcome to build with the technologies of your choice, across any areas that you think would drive impact for these issues, so feel free to think outside the box too!
